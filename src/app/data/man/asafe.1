.SH COMMANDS

.TP
.B check
Checks the Arch Linux Mailing site (https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch.announce/{month}-{year].txt) and lists all announcements who's timestamp is more recent than the date wirtten in /usr/share/asafe/time.

.TP
.B mark-resolved
Updates the time in /usr/share/asafe/time that defnies which announcements are considered to be recent.

.TP
.B set-mode <mode>
Defines the behavior of asafe. <mode> can hold the values disabled, complain or enforced. In disabled mode asafe will only update it's timestamp without visiting the Arch Linux Mailing site. In enforced mode a check that lists recent announcments will exit as failure, this triggering the pacman hook to abort the transaction. In complain mode a check will display recent announcments without returning an error.
